Output Maximization Container Loading Problem With Time Availability Constraints.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The limited storage space using is accounted by the container loading problem by explicitly 
considering the schedule of arrival for the boxes and the departure time of trucks.
A framework is designed which handles the geometric and temporal characteristics of the 
problem separately.

CLPTAC-Om - Output maximization version of a container loading problem with time availability 
constraints.

[0,T]-is a finite time horizon
B-set of boxes , i E B and li1,li2,li3 are lengths of boxes accross each axis.
L1,L2,L3-dimensions of single container.

For deterministic version, arrival time of boxes tiE[0,T],iEB.
For stochastic version, only the probability distribution of ti is known. 

The temporal characteristics are handled by evolution of the dynamic programming while the 
geometric constraints are handled as a part of the sub-problems solved for each possible 
state.

A dynamic programming algorithm is used whether to load the boxes available or wait for 
remaining boxes that might be available in this time period and the loading cost is computed
by considering one of two cases.
Continuation cost matrix and decision matrix are obtained as results.

The data used is two sets of instances generated 47 from [25] and 50 from [9],[20].

The datasets provide three dimensional geometry for the boxes and the containers and a time from 
which it is available is randomly generated by a discrete uniform probability distribution.
